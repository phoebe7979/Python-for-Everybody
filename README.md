# Python-for-Everybody
## This repository contains all Python codes I wrote while taking the course  "Python for Everybody". I use Git Bash to push all progress here to GitHub. I hope I will be able to see a lot of progress at the end of the class.
### PS. The reason why I use Git Bash was because GitPlus doesn't work on my Atom editor. Whenever I want to commit and push, an error message will appear.....
