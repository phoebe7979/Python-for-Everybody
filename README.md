# Python-for-Everybody
This repository contains all Python codes I wrote while taking the course  "Python for Everybody". I previously used Git Bash to push all progress here to GitHub because atom the Git panel didn't work for me, and also because "push" from GitPlus didn't seem to be available on Windows. </br></br>However, after several hours of research and attempts (adding Git Path in the GitPlus settings, download Git Credential Manager, etc.) it finally worked. Now I do not need to write any comman lines on Git Bash and can simply push commits in few clicks on Git panel. However, since I really don't know which step I did right to make it happen, I am going to share with you some resources that I browsed before the miracle moment.</br>
</br>
Please see below the instructions I followed. Maybe this will help your "Push" issues too.  </br>
