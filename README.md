# Python-for-Everybody
This repository contains all Python codes I wrote while taking the course  "Python for Everybody". I previously used Git Bash to push all progress here to GitHub because atom didn't seem to enable "push" with GitPlus on Windows. </br></br>However, after several hours of attempts (adding Git Path in the GitPlus settings, download Git Credential Manager,etc.) it finally worked...on Git panel (even better)! Now I do not need to write any comman lines on Git Bash and can simply push commits in few clicks.</br>
</br>
Please see below the instructions I followed. Maybe this will help your "Push" issues too.
